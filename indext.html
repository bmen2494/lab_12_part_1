<h1>War Is the H-Word</h1> <p>No, she'll probably make me do it. I'll get my kit! Daylight and everything.</p> <h2>The Sting</h2> <p>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! Bender, this is Fry's decision&hellip; and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Then we'll go with that data file!</p> <ul> <li>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</li> <li>And then the battle's not so bad?</li> </ul> <h3>Kif Gets Knocked Up A Notch</h3> <p>And then the battle's not so bad? Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Really?! Shinier than yours, meatbag. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very&hellip;</p> <h4>The Deep South</h4> <p>Fatal. Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Bender, you risked your life to save me! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p> <ol> <li>Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you!</li> <li>I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!</li> </ol> <h5>Bendless Love</h5> <p>Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!</p>
